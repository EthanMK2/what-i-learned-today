# What I learned Today

This repository acts as a kind of archive of what I learned on days with school or personal work. I title the entries in a way that I can look back and recall topics that I learned in the past, and see how much I have grown so far. Do NOT rely on these posts to necessarily learn something new, but to see how much I know and have learned over time.
