# Docker Compose, Orchestration, and Compose Files

I learned about Docker Compose, a tool by Docker that helps applications scale properly across several services. Usually, an application will have several services required to work such as a frontend, backend, database, and any other API such as RESTful API's. Each of these services can be a docker container, where maintenance and configuration is exemplified. But aren't containers isolated, and therefore cannot communicate? Indeed, but this is where Docker Compose comes in to help. A Docker Compose file, like a 'normal' docker file, sets up the configuration and requirments for several containers to run, as well as set up any networks between them. A network can be internal (between the containers) or external (private, isolated networks, and other means). When a container tries to communicate with another service, it will use this network defined in the docker compose file. This is where the emergence of 'orchestration' occurs. This can be its own profession, where engineers have to see the big picture and determine where and how applications are expanded.
