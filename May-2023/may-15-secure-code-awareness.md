# Coding Solutions To Problems With Code That Has Solutions To Other Problems

Secure coding is making a solution that fills a gap of vulnerability, without leaving much if any possibility for exploits. While coding an assignment for a class, I realized that my solution to the problem had introduced a different vulnerability. While preventing an SQL injection, I had to correct my code of a buffer overflow that could cause issues. In essence, if I left the buffer overflow issue, the SQL injection prevention could simply be circumvented through the buffer overflow! This is through crashing the program and finding where the address of a certain function is, and jumping to that function instead of continuing a normal control flow. I learned that secure coding, and coding solutions in general, require a great deal of attention to detail and awareness of multiple moving parts. A system needs to be analyzed through more than one lens, and thoroughly tested for even the most basic vulnerability and exploit.
