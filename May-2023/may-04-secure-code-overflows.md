# Secure Coding Concepts: Fundamentals and Numeric Overflow and Underflow

Secure coding starts at the development level. It spans the early and late stages of development, where we have to make sure to secure our code against threats and user errors. Fundamentals of secure coding inform the policies. Policies set up the what of security. Standards set up the how, and best practices assist that. Optionally, but almost required, is the why, or supporting documents. These lay out the reasoning for why we use certain policies, standards, and best practices. Standards generally need more justification, as the what and why of a secure system is implied in the fundamentals and nature of businesses. Securing bank account numbers is understandable, but how to is up for analysis. 

Today I also learned about numeric overflows in C/C++. A type of number can be overflowed and cause unexpected behavior, and especially disaster when involved in finances or engineering. We wouldn't want an attacker to simply change a zero transfer to a maximum amount transfer for a bank, or a rocket to overcalculate thrust and make the value start from zero again. This is how critical a single concept is, and I'm sure it only gets more complicated from here.
