# Starting to learn AWS Solutions Architect Associate concepts

Today, I started to learn about the AWS services that they offer, through an online course on track to taking the AWS Solutions Architect Associate exam. Overall, I can see the attraction that AWS offers for applications and businesses. We can limit the amount of code we need, as well as host all sorts of data such as pdfs and user activity. AWS enables businesses to scale across any situation: location, service speed, growth of user base, and many other common situations when running a business, web application, or even game server. Today I finished the Identification and Access Management (IAM) section in the course. There are nine things that I must review and keep in mind for the exam, as well as understand how to implement in the AWS console, and how they interact with each other: 
1. Users
2. Groups
3. Policies
4. Roles
5. Security
6. AWS CLI
7. AWS SDK
8. Access Keys
9. Security Audit Tools (credential report and access advisor)
    
So far, it makes a lot of sense and allows for a LOT of customization. For example, I can create a user assign them one or multiple groups. Each group can have a permission policy, many policies, and custom policies. All of these permissions can be analyzed with the audit tools to allow us to track if and when services are used in order to revoke permissions to optimize security. I am already somewhat familiar with IAM policies through my degree program, but it is nice to give it a lot more attention and time to study and understand exactly how it works.
