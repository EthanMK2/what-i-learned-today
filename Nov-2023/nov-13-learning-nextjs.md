# Learning Next.js 14

Recently, I dove into the Next.js 14 tutorial project by Vercel in order to learn a new way (as well as learn the latest trends!) of using React.js in a production setting. Next.js so far is incredible. I am very impressed with how simple the file-based routing is, especially compared to React Router. I will do a direct comparison soon to highlight where I like the differences. One of the features I liked was how the pages are loaded. Next.js makes it simple by wrapping our components in a Suspense element, and telling the async functions whether to not cache results from a database query. It simplifies the process of making pages dynamic or static, and allows a pages to have both kinds at the same time. I am still going through the tutorial, but so far the framework is very nice. I can see why it has become the industry standard for the React libary.
