# Learning EC2

EC2 has a lot of different types of services and instances for solutions to any kind of computing problem. The general purpose ec2 instances are what balance cpu, memory, and storage. A web application would need to know what kind of service it is providing before selecting a type of ec2 instance specialization. For example, if a work order system makes a lot of API calls and analyzes a small amount of data, then a general purpose instance type might be okay. But, if another web application requires a lot of web rendering, such as simulations like webgl, then a compute and/or memory instance may be more appropriate. Another web app that uses a dashboard of data analytics for a massive enterprise may need a specialization type in storage to handle big data. Overall I can see the broad implications that AWS has for businesses, and this is only the web application side. AWS offers a lot more services for all kinds of industries, even game servers.
