# What is a Template Engine, and what is it good for?

A template engine is software used to create dynamic websites based on what data models are set up and retrieved by the server. The server, using node.js let's say, grabs data from a database and stores it in a variable. It then takes this variable, and puts it into an html template made from a template engine. I used Handlebars for one of my school projects, enabling the application to retrieve data and display it to the user from a generated html page. This enabled the user to get a view based on what is stored in the database, like the currrent offers for example. In the project, it set up different offers of vacation packages so that the template engine on the server-side could simply retrieve that data for the view. There was an admin frontend with permissions to modify the database offers, so that users visiting the site could see the new offers almost in real-time. Template engines are great for rapid development and also for enabling dynamic websites that depend on changing data, all the while the end-user's device does not have to send requests to get the data or even spend a lot of time rendering the page.
