# General Artificial Intelligence: Why It Is Impossible (or at least, uncontrollable)

This is the first paragraph of a paper in progress.

AI is very useful in today's world, especially with the recent popularization of ChatGPT and other language models. It can help us understand concepts by re-wording the concepts, and it can help sort images according to what we want to see. There is a theory that AI will eventually get to the point of Artificial General Intelligence, where it can learn anything based on observing the world around it, without human intervention. But, the problem with this theory is that the characteristics needed in order for general intelligence to be achieved, is that it must be creative and autonomous. These are fundamental issues in terms of how general intelligence can be possible, or even controllable.
